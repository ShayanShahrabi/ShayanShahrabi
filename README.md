Hello! I’m Shayan, a BSc student in Computer Science at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU).
My interests broadly include machine learning and deep learning, with a subtle focus on natural language processing and large language models. I enjoy learning about these topics, staying curious, and deepening my understanding through reading and exploration.

You can learn more about my work on my [personal website](https://shayanshahrabi.github.io), and feel free to get in touch if you'd like to connect.
